## Core Features:

- Hero Entrance Animation: Animate the hero section elements on page load with staggered entrance effects to immediately capture attention.
- Scroll-Triggered Animations: Implement animations that are triggered by scrolling, including text distortions, image parallax, and section morphing.
- Custom Cursor Interactions: Design a custom cursor that reacts to different elements on the page, such as changing color on hover or creating a magnetic pull effect.
- Dynamic Typography Motion: Incorporate kinetic typography with text that moves, splits, and rotates in response to user interactions or scrolling.
- Layered Parallax Effects: Create depth by using parallax scrolling on multiple layers to give a sense of immersion and dynamism.
- Experimental Layout Design: Develop an experimental section with asymmetrical layouts and unusual compositions to push the boundaries of traditional web design.

## Style Guidelines:

- Primary accent color: Strong pink (#BF106B) used for highlights, cursor effects, and motion accents.
- Background color: Dark background (#000000) to provide a stark contrast and make the accent color pop.

- Font: 'Space Grotesk', a sans-serif font for headlines, paired with 'Inter' sans-serif font for body text.
- Asymmetrical and experimental layouts to break away from traditional web design.
- Aggressive scroll-triggered animations including text distortion, parallax, and morphing effects.
- Motion blur and looping subtle background motion to enhance the dynamic feel.
- Custom cursor animations, like color change or magnetic effect, when interacting with page elements.
- Use entrance animations, especially staggered entrance of text elements to capture immediate attention
